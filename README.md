** How this game works **

* The player flips one card over to reveal its symbol
* The player then turns over a second card to find the matching card
* If the cards match, both cards stay flipped over
* If the cards don't match, both cards are flipped face down
* The game ends once all cards have been matched
* The result shows at the end of the game
